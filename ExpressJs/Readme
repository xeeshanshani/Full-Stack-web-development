Express.js
Express.js is a fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is designed to make it easy to build scalable and secure web applications.

Installation
To install Express.js, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
npm install express
This will install the latest version of Express.js and its dependencies.

Getting Started
To get started with Express.js, you can create a new project and install the express package, like this:

bash
Copy code
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
npm init -y
npm install express
Then, create a new file called app.js and add the following code:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
This creates a new Express.js application that listens on port 3000 and responds to HTTP GET requests to the root URL with the message "Hello World!".

You can start the application by running the following command:

Copy code
node app.js
Then, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the "Hello World!" message.

Features
Express.js provides a number of features that make it a powerful framework for building web applications, including:

Routing: Express.js provides a simple and flexible way to handle HTTP requests based on URL patterns.

Middleware: Express.js supports middleware functions that can be used to modify the request and response objects, add functionality to the application, and more.

Templating: Express.js supports a variety of templating engines that can be used to render dynamic content in HTML, such as Pug, Handlebars, and EJS.

Error handling: Express.js provides a robust error handling system that allows you to handle errors in a consistent and predictable way.
